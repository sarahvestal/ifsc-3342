    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!-- Hey Thomas! --> 
    <p><img src="assets/img/content-image2.jpg" alt="need a beer?" class="oldman"/>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity. 
        Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message 
        is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be 
        reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish 
        too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
